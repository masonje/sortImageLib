## image sorter
Just a simple script I want to use to sort the images from my phone to my nas.  I want to sort them in a year/month/day format.

#### sortImages.py
Reads **settings.json** for it's config. I should probably put logging leven in it too, but don't care yet. Current path is there as a smb network mount in ubuntu. Update as you would navigate to it. I'll probably find a vm to cron this on and have a better mount point. 

#### sortv2.sh
A script I don't use any more but wanted to save off here as it's the place to save my sorting script.
